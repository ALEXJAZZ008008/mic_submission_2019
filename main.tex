%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.

% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:

%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:

% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:

% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array

% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig

% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e

%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix

%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.

% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***

%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for

% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed

% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by the IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:

% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.

\IEEEPARstart{R}{espiratory} motion, during positron emission tomography (PET) acquisitions, accounts for artefacts and loss of resolution in the thoracic region. This is detrimental as it reduces the certainty with which conclusions can be made from the data. For instance, a lesion which is near the boarder between the lung and the liver may appear to be in one in the data while in actuality it is in the other.

In order to attempt to correct for respiratory motion many methods have been proposed, most of which utilise some form of registration. A solely registration based method is not ideal though as it is susceptible to noise.

A current trend in the literature seems to be the research of motion models. A motion model attempts to relate the motion apparent in the data to some surrogate signal, for instance, the displacement of the anterior and posterior surface or the position of the diaphragm. The model outputs a transformation or deformation field back to the reference geometry for every value of the surrogate signal.

Motion models could be superior to a solely registration based methods as they best fit the motion at a given time point to a line through the data rather than having an individual measure of the motion at every measured time point.

When it comes to the issue of calculating a motion model there is the paradox of how to or if to apply attenuation correction to the initial PET activity distribution. If attenuation is corrected, using a static attenuation map, before the motion model is calculated then there is a high likelihood that the artefacts caused by the misalignment of the activity distribution and the attenuation map would hide the underlying motion of the anatomy. However, if attenuation is not corrected then the contrast may be too low and the noise too great in the activity distribution to calculate an accurate motion model. Usually after this initial motion estimation is made the activity distribution and attenuation map can be warped based on the motion estimate, thus removing the constraint on attenuation correction.

In PET, the position of each activity event is detected as a line-of-response (LOR) that connects two detectors. The measure of the time-of-flight (TOF) difference between the two detectors allows for the localisation of the position of the activity event to within a range along the LOR dictated by the TOF resolution of the scanner.

In nonTOF reconstruction, the surface of the body has a greater contrast as there is no time information, therefore there is no information on the activity event position along the LOR, the activity event probability along the LOR is the same. In the absence of attenuation correction, the reconstruction will place the events with greater probability towards the surface of the body. In TOF reconstruction, there is greater contrast inside the body because of the time information constraining the activity event position via changes of the activity event probability along the LOR.

Thus, here we perform an evaluation as to whether TOF reconstruction on non-attenuation-corrected (NAC) PET data can adequately increase the contrast and lower the noise of the activity distribution to facilitate the calculation of an accurate motion model.

\section{Methods}
In order to test the assertion discussed above multiple applications have been written to acquire data, simulate data, reconstruct data and calculate motion models. To acquire the input data extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) was used to generate 6 volumes over a linear 5 second breathing cycle, with 1 volume at full expiration at the beginning of the cycle and 1 volume at full expiration at the end of the cycle. The breathing signal passed to XCAT to animate the phantom was the default displacement of the anterior and posterior surface and the position of the diaphragm. XCAT was also used to generate a ground truth volume at the mean position of the breathing cycle for use to evaluate the results later. All volumes had a field of view showing the bottom of the lungs, diaphragm and top of the liver with a 40mm diameter spherical lesion placed into the lung.

To simulate a PET acquisition an application was written which used the Software for Tomographic Image Reconstruction (STIR) through the Synergistic Image Reconstruction Framework (SIRF) to forward project the input data to sinograms. The model used to forward project also applied a suitable amount of noise to simulate an acquisition of any given time, in this instance it treated the data as if it had been gated into 6 bins over an acquisition of 120 seconds, this emulated a standard single bed position acquisition. The model used had the geometry of a GE Discovery 710 and, where relevant, a TOF resolution similar to the upcoming GE Signa, this was 13 TOF time bins, timing bins of size 376.5ps and a timing resolution of 375ps with a TOF mashing factor of 1. The simulation application applied attenuation to each volume using the relevant attenuation map generated by XCAT

To reconstruct the PET acquisitions simulated above again STIR was used through SIRF using the Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximisation reconstruction algorithm using 9 sub-iterations and 18 subsets. Again the model used had the geometry of a GE Discovery 710. The reconstruction application did not apply attenuation correction.

To calculate motion models NiftyRegResp was used using the sum of squared differences as it's objective function. The surrogate signal passed to NiftyRegResp consisted of both the displacement of the anterior and posterior surface and the position of the diaphragm from XCAT, these signals were normalised to be between -1 and 1 with a mean value of 0. NiftyRegResp can use the motion model, which has been calculated, to perform a motion compensated reconstruction (MCR) to attempt to correct for the respiratory motion.

    \caption{This figure shows on the left a MCR of the nonTOF data and on the right a MCR of the TOF data}
\end{figure}

\section{Results}
In order to evaluate the motion models generated above the motion model calculated from the input data, the nonTOF reconstruction and the TOF reconstruction was applied in inverse to the ground truth volume which was generated at the mean position of the breathing cycle as discussed above. This created 3 lots of 6 volumes which should be estimated to be as close as possible to the original 6 input volumes generated by XCAT.

The volumes created using the motion model calculated from the input data could be considered to be the ground truth estimated input volumes to which the volumes estimated from the motion models calculated from the nonTOF and TOF data could be compared.

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, as can be seen in the figures above, the motion model calculated from the TOF data appears to more closely match the ground truth motion model when it comes to the motion of the liver, diaphragm, heart and lesion. However, it seems that the nonTOF data more accurately represents the motion of the surface of the body.

Because it is the motion of the heavily attenuated internal organs that is difficult to estimate with NAC data it is likely that TOF derived motion model is more suitable to start an iterative motion correction algorithm with.

A large disadvantage of the TOF reconstruction is that it greatly increases the time investment in both reconstruction and calculating the motion model.

In the future it may be interesting to combine both the nonTOF data with the TOF data to estimate both the surface and internal motion with greater accuracy. However, this woud increase processing time exponentially.
